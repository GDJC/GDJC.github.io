We have launched two ad hoc working groups, each work on a systematic review of a topic relevant to diabetes research.\nOne of the systematic reviews investigates the effectiveness of using telemedicine interventions relevant for primary care setting in prevention of type 2 diabetes.\nThe other systematic review investigates the availability and performance of risk prediction models for incident type 2 diabetes.\nEffectiveness of telemedicine in prevention of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions relevant for primary care settings\nThe systematic review is registered in PROSPERO.\nThe main review question is: What is the effectiveness of using telemedicine interventions relevant for primary care setting in prevention of type 2 diabetes?\nWe will search for relevant literature in the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, SciELO and LILACS.\nTypes of study to be included\nWe will include all types of intervention studies, including randomized and non-randomized interventions. Observational studies are excluded.\nWe decided to also include non-randomized interventions to broaden the scope of our review as our preliminary search revealed many recent publications of innovative interventions without a control group.\nWe will exclude studies that are more than 10 years old (i.e. 2010 and older) because the technologies used 10 years ago are likely outdated and not relevant today. Condition or domain being studied Prevention of type 2 diabetes.\nParticipants/population\nAdults (age ≥18 years) at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes according to the study-specific definition of ‘high risk.’ This includes prediabetes diagnosis, metabolic syndrome, overweight/obesity, and/or use of prediabetes screening tools. Studies including children, people with established type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes and/or other metabolic or mental health conditions will be excluded.\nWe decided to be agnostic about the specific definition of high risk of type 2 diabetes because our preliminary search revealed no standardization of this categorization and because all groups would be relevant for prevention of type 2 diabetes.\nIntervention/exposure\nAny lifestyle interventions (e.g. diet, physical activity) or medicine (e.g. metformin) delivered using telemedicine, including various mHealth, eHealth and other technologically assisted or conducted interventions. The intervention should be relevant to or take place at a primary health care setting.\nWe decided to focus on interventions carried out in primary care settings or in settings that resemble primary care settings to best inform which interventions would be relevant, if any, in primary care settings, without necessarily restricting studies to only being carried out in such a setting.\nComparator/control\nThere is no restriction on the type of control, but studies will be grouped according to control being: 1) usual care, 2) lifestyle intervention without telemedicine or 3) absent.\nWe decided to include different types of control groups as these answer different research questions relevant to the main research question.\nMain outcome\nBody weight change.\nWe chose this as the primary outcome because it is clinically relevant and often the outcome that studies base their power calculations on. Measures of effect Mean difference.\nAdditional outcomes\nIncidence of type 2 diabetes\nChanges in fasting blood glucose\nChanges in HbA1c\nChanges in 2-hour glucose tolerance\nChanges in HOMA-IR\nChanges in blood lipids\nChanges in blood pressure\nChanges in waist circumference\nReview Team\nDaniel Ibsen.

Jie Zhang - Intergenerational transmission of obesity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Jie Zhang, a PhD student from the the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Denmark, on BMI in parents and their adult offspring.\nShe presented preliminary findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis she is working on. The main finding was that there is an association between parent BMI and their adult offspring’s BMI, meaning that if the parent’s BMI is high, then it is more likely that their children’s BMI is also higher.\nJie’s overview of the relation between intergenerational transmission of obesityAnother key finding was that there was virtually no difference between the mother-offspring and father-offspring association, suggesting that the intrauterine effect (see figure above) may not be as strong, as previously suggested.\nWe look forward to see the published results of this very interesting work in the near future.\nSeptember 2021\nDr. Randi K. Johnson - Expanding the search for metabolomics risk factors in type 1 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Randi K. Johnson, an Assistant Professor from the University of Colorado School of Medicine, on the use of metabolomics in the search for new risk factors for type 1 diabetes.\nShe gave an overview of what metabolomics is about, what type 1 diabetes is, risk factors for type 1 diabetes, and provided examples of her previous work using metabolomics to investigate dietary pattern in progression to type 1 diabetes.\nPaper 1: Metabolome-wide association study in mAb+ risk\nPaper 2: Metabolite-wide association study in progression to type 1 diabetes\nShe also discussed some future perspectives investigating metabotypes influenced by genes to better understand some of the important risk factors inspired by a paper by Suhre et al. 2016.\nThe recording was stopped towards the end because she presented preliminary data that has not yet been peer reviewed.\nAugust 2021\nDr. Tessa Strain - Where do adults accumulate their physical activity?

However, this may be due to poor adjustment of relevant confounders, which this paper suggests.\nJuly 2021\nDr. Lasse Bjerg - Multistate models in type 1 diabetes - taking the complication state into account\nGDJC July 2021 TalkGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Lasse Bjerg, Postdoc at the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus in Denmark, on multistate models on type 1 diabetes.\nUnfortunately, we were not able to record this session, but here is a recap of the main points.\nMultistate model of type 1 diabetes complications and mortalityMultistate models are a powerful tool to understand disease transitions. However, there are some drawbacks:\nThe model gets very complicated the more states that are included, 3-4 seems to be a max.\nThe model also regard transitions as instantaneous, although this is not always be the case. Example: ok for myocardial infarction, not so for diabetic kidney disease or retinopathy.\nRequires a lot of longitudinal data, typically in the form of a register.\nThe talk was based on this paper about duration of diabetes-related complications and mortality in type 1 diabetes using Swedish register data.\nJune 2021\nJosé Luis Flores-Guerrero – Branched chain amino acids and risk of type 2 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by José Luis Flores-Guerrero, PhD student at the the University Medical Center Gröningen in the Netherlands, on circulating branched chain amino acids and risk of type 2 diabetes.\nHe gives a detailed background of the topic, potential mechanisms that explain the relationship and discuss some of his own studies investigating branched chain amino acids and risk of type 2 diabetes based on the Dutch PREVEND cohort.\nThe talk is based on several of his papers on type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertension.\nDuring the discussion a Mendelian randomization study was also mentioned.\nMay 2021\nDr. Thaddäus Tönnies – Productivity-adjusted life years lost to type 2 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Thaddäus Tönnies, epidemiologists at the German Diabetes Center in Düsseldorf, on productivity-adjusted life years lost due to type 2 diabetes in Germany.\nHe elegantly explains the illness-death model, the assumptions behind his projections and the concept of years of life lost and productivity-adjusted years of life lost.\nThe talk is based on this paper.\nHe also mentions a paper about the projected number of people with diabetes in Germany in 2040.\nApril 2021\nAdrian Ahne – Diabetes distress patterns based on social media data using AI methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Adrian Ahne, PhD Student from INSERM, Epiconcept & University Paris Saclay, on identification of diabetes-related distress pattern based on social media data using artificial intelligence methods in the World Diabetes Distress Study.\nThe talk is based on this paper\nMarch 2021\nDr. Suping Ling - Investigating causality between type 2 diabetes and cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Suping Ling from the University of Leicester on the relation between diabetes and cancer.\nThe talk is based on a meta-analysis she lead and during the talk she also discuss bias analysis for unmeasured confounding.\nThe paper can be found here\nFebruary 2021\nDr. Jason Torres - Tissue-level classification of loci associated with type 2 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Jason Torres from Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, on tissue-level classification of loci associated with type 2 diabetes.\nThe talk is based on Torres et al. 2020\nHere is a paper we recommend reading for context\n\n\n\n",

For the subgroups, he also presented results from an ongoing study.\nJune 2022\nDr. Lauren Wedekind - Investigating the relationship between birth weight and type 2 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur June GDJC Talk, marking 3 years since our first one, was given by Lauren Wedekind, one of our GDJC organizers. Lauren shared work from her PhD research on diabetes and birth weight and summarized some previous work that inspired it. Themes she reviewed included the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, the foetal insulin hypothesis, and the genetic and non-genetic influences on the relationship between birth weight and diabetes (which in some study populations has been found to be U-shaped).\nShe summarized her work on genome-wide association studies of birth weight and using clinical and genetic information to predict incident diabetes: click here for more articles and abstracts she has co-authored on these topics.\nLauren used this talk as a practice presentation for her PhD thesis defense, which was closed to the public, so she invited friends, family and colleagues. Thus, this talk was specifically designed to be accessible to all, and used terms that those without formal training in diabetes or epidemiology can better understand.

Note, the study is not yet published, meaning that the results have yet to be peer reviewed. We will give an update, when the study has been published.\nThe study was based on data from the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018-2019 and the study protocol was pre-registered here\nIn the talk she describes the overlapping etiology of diabetes and depression within biological, environmental, social and behavioral aspects.\nThe key findings in the study was that women had a higher prevalence of diabetes than men and women also had a higher prevalence of depression than men. In particular, their interaction analysis suggested that there was an additive interaction. Meaning that women with diabetes was more likely to have depression above what is expected based on having diabetes or being a women alone.\nApril 2022\nDr. Cassie Mitchell and Statistician Emma Stinson - Metabolic responses to a mixed meal tolerance test in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Cassie Mitchell, PhD, RD (postdoctoral fellow) and Emma Stinson, MPH (statistician) at NIH/NIDDK Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch jointly presented their work on metabolic responses to a mixed meal tolerance test in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes.\nIn their study, they compared the association between different metrics, such as the area under the curve, from the oral glucose tolerance test or a mixed meal tolerance test and risk of type 2 diabetes.\nIn the Q&A there were several interesting questions. Firstly, it is worth noting that the population in this study were relatively young (mean age about 26 years) and were all mostly indigenous populations which are known to have a higher genetic predisposition to develop type 2 diabetes. This may make it hard to compare the results to other populations. Overall, the oral glucose tolerance test provided greater absolute glucose values due to a higher dose compared to the mixed meal. The mixed meal may not stress the system in a similar way and hence may not be able to detect early stages of risk.\nOn the other hand, a mixed meal challenge may be easier to handle for the participants. The mixed meal used here consisted of 40 energy from carbohydrates, 40% from fat and 20% from protein. The total energy contribution was 33% of total daily energy need. One issue with the mixed meal is, however, that it is hard to standardize across studies because there is no consensus on the composition or which foods to use.\nOne of the advantages of using a mixed meal challenge is that is may reveal other metabolic dysfunctions than only glucose which the oral glucose tolerance test is designed for. However, more research from this project will cast light on this question.\nLastly, future investigations of this dataset will look at various other measures of the glucose curves to examine other differences between the mixed meal challenge and oral glucose tolerance test.\nMarch 2022\nAnthony Muchai Manyara - Comparison of risk factors between people with and without type 2 diabetes in Nairobi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Anthony Muchai Manyara from the University of Glasgow, gave our March 2022 GDJC Talk on the topic of risk factors in people with and without type 2 diabetes in Nairobi, Africa. The talk was based on this paper.\nThe discussion after the talk focused on how the controls were sampled and potential issues with this. Although the methods for doing this in the study was not ideal (asking participants to bring a frend of similar age and sex), there was also a practical consideration that this was deemed the best way of recruiting controls under the circumstances.\nThe study also revealed some interesting findings regarding differences in grip strengths and central adiposity between those with and without type 2 diabetes.\nAll in all, the study points to some risk factors like grip strength and central adiposity as being important to monitor in this setting prospective studies are needed to investigate these further.\nFebruary 2022\nResearch Associate, Alisa Kjaergaard - Mendelian randomization: causal inference without intervention?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Research Associate Alisa Kjaergaard from the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark, on Mendelian randomization with examples related to diabetes research. Dr. Kjaergaard gave an introduction to the key concepts of Mendelian Randomization. Indeed, this talk is very relevant to those new to the topic of Mendelian Randomization.\nHer most recent published studies include Mendelian Randomization and regular observational studies investigating the link between obesity and kidney funtion, thyroid function and sex hormones and homocysteine and female fertility.\nDuring the Q&A, which was not recorded, we also the use of causal language, the issue with pleiotropy in two-sample Mendelian randomization and issues with using machine learning methods to identify a large number of genetic polymorphisms associated with an exposure of interest.\nFor more information about Dr. Kjaergaard follow this link\n\n\n\n",

Prof. Leo Martinez on Twitter @LeoMarti_EpiTB\nOctober 2021\nPhd Stud. Jie Zhang - Intergenerational transmission of obesity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Jie Zhang, a PhD student from the the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Denmark, on BMI in parents and their adult offspring.\nShe presented preliminary findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis she is working on. The main finding was that there is an association between parent BMI and their adult offspring’s BMI, meaning that if the parent’s BMI is high, then it is more likely that their children’s BMI is also higher.\nJie’s overview of the relation between intergenerational transmission of obesityAnother key finding was that there was virtually no difference between the mother-offspring and father-offspring association, suggesting that the intrauterine effect (see figure above) may not be as strong, as previously suggested.\nWe look forward to see the published results of this very interesting work in the near future.\nFollow Jie Zhang on Twitter @EvelynZ31667894\nSeptember 2021\nDr. Randi K.

An analysis of data from 104 countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Tessa Strain, a postdoctoral fellow in the Physical Activity Epidemiology group at the MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, on where adults accumulate their physical activity.\nShe provided an overview of current physical activity guidelines that focus on moderate to vigorous physical activity and thereafter discuss a study she lead on characterizing where adults from 104 different countries get the physical activity from.\nThe figure below show the most recent physical activity guidelines from WHO\nWHO physical activity guildeinesThe talk was based this paper published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine\nDuring the discussion we also talk about the physical activity paradox, where greater levels of occupational physical activity should be linked to higher risk of mortality. However, this may be due to poor adjustment of relevant confounders, which this paper suggests.\nFollow Dr. Tessa Strain on Twitter @tessastraining\nJuly 2021\nDr. Lasse Bjerg - Multistate models in type 1 diabetes - taking the complication state into account\nGDJC July 2021 TalkGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Lasse Bjerg, Postdoc at the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus in Denmark, on multistate models on type 1 diabetes.\nUnfortunately, we were not able to record this session, but here is a recap of the main points.\nMultistate model of type 1 diabetes complications and mortalityMultistate models are a powerful tool to understand disease transitions. However, there are some drawbacks:\nThe model gets very complicated the more states that are included, 3-4 seems to be a max.\nThe model also regard transitions as instantaneous, although this is not always be the case. Example: ok for myocardial infarction, not so for diabetic kidney disease or retinopathy.\nRequires a lot of longitudinal data, typically in the form of a register.\nThe talk was based on this paper about duration of diabetes-related complications and mortality in type 1 diabetes using Swedish register data.\nFollow Lasse @bjerg_lasse\nJune 2021\nJosé Luis Flores-Guerrero – Branched chain amino acids and risk of type 2 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by José Luis Flores-Guerrero, PhD student at the the University Medical Center Gröningen in the Netherlands, on circulating branched chain amino acids and risk of type 2 diabetes.\nHe gives a detailed background of the topic, potential mechanisms that explain the relationship and discuss some of his own studies investigating branched chain amino acids and risk of type 2 diabetes based on the Dutch PREVEND cohort.\nThe talk is based on several of his papers on type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertension.\nDuring the discussion a Mendelian randomization study was also mentioned.\nFollow José Luis on Twitter @JLuis_FG\nMay 2021\nDr. Thaddäus Tönnies – Productivity-adjusted life years lost to type 2 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Thaddäus Tönnies, epidemiologists at the German Diabetes Center in Düsseldorf, on productivity-adjusted life years lost due to type 2 diabetes in Germany.\nHe elegantly explains the illness-death model, the assumptions behind his projections and the concept of years of life lost and productivity-adjusted years of life lost.\nThe talk is based on this paper.\nHe also mentions a paper about the projected number of people with diabetes in Germany in 2040.\nFollow Dr. Tönnies on Twitter @ThaddausTonnies\nApril 2021\nAdrian Ahne – Diabetes distress patterns based on social media data using AI methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Adrian Ahne, PhD Student from INSERM, Epiconcept & University Paris Saclay, on identification of diabetes-related distress pattern based on social media data using artificial intelligence methods in the World Diabetes Distress Study.\nThe talk is based on this paper\nFollow Adrian on Twitter @Adrahne\nMarch 2021\nDr. Suping Ling - Investigating causality between type 2 diabetes and cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Suping Ling from the University of Leicester on the relation between diabetes and cancer.\nThe talk is based on a meta-analysis she lead and during the talk she also discuss bias analysis for unmeasured confounding.\nThe paper can be found here\nFebruary 2021\nDr. Jason Torres - Tissue-level classification of loci associated with type 2 diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Jason Torres from Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, on tissue-level classification of loci associated with type 2 diabetes.\nThe talk is based on Torres et al. 2020\nHere is a paper we recommend reading for context\nFollow Dr. Torres @JMTorres138\n\n\n\n",
