Welcome to the Global Diabetes Journal Club (GDJC) website! We aim to sustain a collegial, accessible platform for diabetes researchers, health care providers and the public to connect and learn about recent research across nutritional, clinical and genetic epidemiology as they apply to diabetes. We are committed to supporting early-career researchers interested in diabetes epidemiology. Our members have joined GDJC meetings from 6 continents. 

We run two main programs:

  - **GDJC Talks** Monthly hour-long Zoom meetings that include an article/project presentation and discussion. 
  - **Ad hoc working groups** In Summer 2020, we created two research teams, each of which is preparing a systematic review on an aspect of prevention of type 2 diabetes. 
  
If you want stay updated, please join our mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/g/global-diabetes-journal-club), where we send announcements and reminders for our upcoming talks and other relevant events.

## Latest GDJC Talk

### September 2022 - Jakub Morze, PhD student - Evidence synthesis in molecular epidemiology

Jakub Morze, MD and PhD student at the University of Warmia and Mazury and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health gives a talk about the complexity of synthesizing evidence in molecular epidemiology using his recent systematic review of metabolites and type 2 diabetes risk as an example. 

Link to the paper [here](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/45/4/1013/144892/Metabolomics-and-Type-2-Diabetes-Risk-An-Updated).

Towards the end of the talk he discussed a lot of the issue he experienced conducting this review. 

After the presentation we followed on some of the issues presented, for instance that there are no Risk of Bias assessment tools developed particularly for molecular epidemiology, that the current way of updating systematic reviews is a slow process which could be improved and that future studies would benefit from measuring metabolites multiple times.
