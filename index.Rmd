Welcome to the Global Diabetes Journal Club (GDJC) website! We aim to sustain a collegial, accessible platform for diabetes researchers, health care providers and the public to connect and learn about recent research across nutritional, clinical and genetic epidemiology as they apply to diabetes. Our members have joined GDJC meetings from 6 continents. 

We run two main programs:

  - **GDJC Talks** Monthly hour-long Zoom meetings that include an article/project presentation and discussion. 
  - **Ad hoc working groups** In Summer 2020, we created two research teams, each of which is preparing a systematic review on an aspect of prevention of type 2 diabetes.

Dr. Anthony Muchai Manyara from the University of Glasgow, gave our March 2022 GDJC Talk on the topic of risk factors in people with and without type 2 diabetes in Nairobi, Africa. The talk was based on [this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.13629). 

During the Q&A, which was not recorded, the discussion focused on how the controls were sampled and potential issues with this. Although the method for doing this in the study was not ideal (asking cases, people with type 2 diabetes, to bring a friend of similar age and sex), there was also a practical consideration that this was deemed the best way of recruiting controls under the circumstances. 

The study also revealed some interesting findings regarding differences in grip strengths and central adiposity between those with and without type 2 diabetes.

All in all, the study points to some risk factors like grip strength and central adiposity as being important to monitor in this setting prospective studies are needed to investigate these further.
