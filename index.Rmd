Welcome to the Global Diabetes Journal Club (GDJC) website! We aim to sustain a collegial, accessible platform for diabetes researchers, health care providers and the public to connect and learn about recent research across nutritional, clinical and genetic epidemiology as they apply to diabetes. Our members have joined GDJC meetings from 6 continents. 

We run two main programs:

  - **GDJC Talks** Monthly hour-long Zoom meetings that include an article/project presentation and discussion. 
  - **Ad hoc working groups** In Summer 2020, we created two research teams, each of which is preparing a systematic review on an aspect of prevention of type 2 diabetes.

Global Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Assistant Professor Leo Martinez from the Department of Epidemiology at Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, on how a diagnosis of tuberculosis links with development of diabetes.

A recent [paper](https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202007-2634OC) from his group investigated glucose trajectories in patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis in Eastern China and concluded "Among patients with tuberculosis without diabetes, glycemic changes were common and may represent an important marker for patient response to tuberculosis treatment"
