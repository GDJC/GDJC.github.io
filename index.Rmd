Welcome to the Global Diabetes Journal Club (GDJC) website! We aim to sustain a collegial, accessible platform for diabetes researchers, health care providers and the public to connect and learn about recent research across nutritional, clinical and genetic epidemiology as they apply to diabetes. Our members have joined GDJC meetings from 6 continents. 

We run two main programs:

  - **GDJC Talks** Monthly hour-long Zoom meetings that include an article/project presentation and discussion. 
  - **Ad hoc working groups** In Summer 2020, we created two research teams, each of which is preparing a systematic review on an aspect of prevention of type 2 diabetes. 
  
If you want stay updated, please join our mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/g/global-diabetes-journal-club) where also announce upcoming talks and other relevant events.

## Upcoming talks

### Assistant Professor, Leo Martinez - Glycemic trajectories after tuberculosis diagnosis

Assistant Professor Leo Martinez from the Department of Epidemiology at Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, will talk about his research on how a diagnosis of tuberculosis links with development of diabetes.

A recent [paper](https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202007-2634OC) from his group investigated glucose trajectories in patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis in Eastern China and concluded "Among patients with tuberculosis without diabetes, glycemic changes were common and may represent an important marker for patient response to tuberculosis treatment"

Global Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Jie Zhang, a PhD student from the the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Denmark, on BMI in parents and their adult offspring.

She presented preliminary findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis she is working on. The main finding was that there is an association between parent BMI and their adult offspring's BMI, meaning that if the parent's BMI is high, then it is more likely that their children's BMI is also higher.

Another key finding was that there was virtually no difference between the mother-offspring and father-offspring association, suggesting that the intrauterine effect (see figure above) may not be as strong, as previously suggested. 

We look forward to see the published results of this very interesting work in the near future.
