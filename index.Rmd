Welcome to the Global Diabetes Journal Club (GDJC) website! We aim to sustain a collegial, accessible platform for diabetes researchers, health care providers and the public to connect and learn about recent research across nutritional, clinical and genetic epidemiology as they apply to diabetes. Our members have joined GDJC meetings from 6 continents. 

We run two main programs:

  - **GDJC Talks** Monthly hour-long Zoom meetings that include an article/project presentation and discussion. 
  - **Ad hoc working groups** In Summer 2020, we created two research teams, each of which is preparing a systematic review on an aspect of prevention of type 2 diabetes. 
  
If you want stay updated, please join our mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/g/global-diabetes-journal-club) where also announce upcoming talks and other relevant events.

Global Diabetes Journal Club Talk by Dr. Randi K. Johnson, an Assistant Professor from the University of Colorado School of Medicine, on the use of metabolomics in the search for new risk factors for type 1 diabetes.

She gave an overview of what metabolomics is about, what type 1 diabetes is, risk factors for type 1 diabetes, and provided examples of her previous work using metabolomics to investigate dietary pattern in progression to type 1 diabetes.

Paper 1: [Metabolome-wide association study in mAb+ risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31616039/)

Paper 2: [Metabolite-wide association study in progression to type 1 diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32686271/)

She also discussed some future perspectives investigating metabotypes influenced by genes to better understand some of the important risk factors inspired by a paper by [Suhre et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26432701/).

The recording was stopped towards the end because she presented preliminary data that has not yet been peer reviewed.
