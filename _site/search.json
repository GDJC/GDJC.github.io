We aim to sustain a collegial, accessible platform for diabetes researchers, health care providers and the public to connect and learn about recent research across nutritional, clinical and genetic epidemiology as they apply to diabetes. Our members have joined GDJC meetings from 6 continents.\r\nWe run two main programs:\r\nGDJC Talks One hour long Zoom meetings that comprise an article/project presentation and discussion.\r\nAd hoc working groups In Summer 2020, we created two research teams, each of which is preparing a systematic review on an aspect of prevention of type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
